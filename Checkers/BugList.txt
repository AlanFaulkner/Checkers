Known bugs.

Only sigmoid function seems to work with the backpropagation algorithm. Attempts to use TanH, sigmoidal, and ReLu result in NaN error for the weights.

Changing the depth in minmax player doesn’t seem to drastically improve AI.
MinMax player is somewhat defeatist.

Evolve_NN_Evaluator is slow. Paralysation of main algorithm may help to speed this up.

Neural network architecture is static and fully feed forward in nature. Evolving both connectivity and number of neurons/layers may improve overall performance of network. This will cause a 
massive increase in overall speed however.

Background worker complete function is unable to update the title bar text of windows form. While this originally worked fine it suddenly reports not initialised error despite no changes to 
code. Current offending lines are commented out.

General input checking with file names and existance of file has not been included.
